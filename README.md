# eye-of-horus
A face and gesture recognition security camera, the eye of horus is my Final Year University of Plymouth Project that will account for 40 credits of my grade this year. My supervisor for this project is [Professor Nathan Clark](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/nathan-clarke).

Code related tasks will be recorded on the [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/M-Davies/eye-of-horus/projects/1) to allow for greater automation and drawing of references between tasks.

# Project Vision
**For:** Users looking to protect their assets within safes or rooms and need a more reliable and secure solution than an easily stolen key or forgetful passphrase.

**Whose:** Problem of those who forget their forms of authentication or wish for only a single group of authorised people access to an asset.

**The**: Eye of Horus.

**Is A**: Facial and gesture recognition hybrid smart lock camera system.

**That**: Combines two common biometric security features into one camera. It provides a secure, helpful authorisation system into a room, safe, house, you name it! Without the need to remember keys or passphrases, this camera uses facial recognition to recognise you as an authorised party to the asset as well as gesture recognition to accept a premade unlock pattern. To lock again, simply exit the asset and commit your locking gesture while looking up at the camera, exactly the same as what youâ€™ve already done! Forgot either gesture? No problem! Simply use our app to scan a QR code that will reset your gesture there and then so you can make a new one!
